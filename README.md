# Scripts
Scripts from my time at UWIN - Use with caution. Also shoutout to kaldi b/c I uploaded my modified run.sh files and some stuff

All the .sh stuff is just to showcase some of the modifications you need to make to the Kaldi default scripts. It should be 
noted that the numbers in the partitioning step are reflective of the default and if you want to maintain the same rations
you'd need to recalculate those numbers.
